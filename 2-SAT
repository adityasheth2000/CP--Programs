Let's look at the example in 2-CNF form:
(a∨¬b)∧(¬a∨b)∧(¬a∨¬b)∧(a∨¬c)

The oriented graph will contain the following vertices and edges:
¬a⇒¬b
b⇒a
a⇒b
¬b⇒¬a
a⇒¬b
b⇒¬a
¬a⇒¬c
c⇒a

In order for this 2-SAT problem to have a solution, it is necessary and sufficient that for any variable x  the vertices x and ¬x are in different strongly connected components of the strong connection of the implication graph.

Note that, in spite of the fact that the solution exists, it can happen that ¬x is reachable from x in the implication graph, or that (but not simultaneously) x is reachable from ¬x. In that case the choice of either true or false for x will lead to a contradiction, while the choice of the other one will not. Let's learn how to choose a value, such that we don't generate a contradiction.

Let us sort the strongly connected components in topological order (i.e. comp[v]≤comp[u] if there is a path from v to u) and let comp[v] denote the index of strongly connected component to which the vertex v belongs. Then, if comp[x]<comp[¬x] we assign x with false and true otherwise.

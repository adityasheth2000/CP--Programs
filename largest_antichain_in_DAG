The largest antichain in a DAG can be found by Dilwort's theorem along with Konig's theorem

Algorithm for finding largest antichain:
1) Make two partitions A(1 to n) and B(1 to n).
2) Make undirected edge from (a of A) to (b of B) iff a<b in DAG.
3) Find the maximum matching m in the above bipartite graph.
4) Largest antichain for above graph= n-m.

/*
A Linear Diophantine Equation (in two variables) is an equation of the general form:

ax+by=c
where a, b, c are given integers, and x, y are unknown integers.

In this article, we consider several classical problems on these equations:

finding one solution
finding all solutions
finding the number of solutions and the solutions themselves in a given interval
finding a solution with minimum value of x+y
*/

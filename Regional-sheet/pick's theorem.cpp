/*
Given a simple polygon constructed on a grid of equal distanced points
(i.e., points with integer coordinates) such that all polygon's vertices are 
grid points, Pick's theorem provides a simple formula for calculating the 
Area A of this polygon in terms of the number of interior points i and
boundary points b.

A= i + (b/2.0) -1;
i=number of interior point in polygon.
b=number of boundary point in polygon.
